## GitHub Actions and Docker CI/CD Pipeline for Java Maven Project
# Introduction
This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker for a Java Maven project. It automates the process of code integration, Docker image building, and deployment using Terraform.

# Workflow Overview
The CI/CD pipeline is triggered on every push to the master branch. The workflow includes the following steps:
Checking Out Repository Code: Utilizes actions/checkout@v4.
Java and Maven Setup: Sets up Java 17 using actions/setup-java@v3.
Versioning: Automates version bumping with Maven.
Committing Changes: Automates git operations for version changes.
Docker Buildx Setup: Prepares Docker environment using docker/setup-buildx-action@v3.
Docker Hub Login: Uses docker/login-action@v3 for Docker Hub authentication.
Metadata Extraction and Image Building: Extracts metadata and builds Docker images using docker/metadata-action@v4 and docker/build-push-action@v5.
Terraform Init and Apply: Initializes and applies Terraform configurations for deployment.
